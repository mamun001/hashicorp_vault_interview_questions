#### 1. What have you done with Vault?

   Answer: 

   Of course, the answer will depend on your unique experiences. 
   
   However, a prepared and practiced answer goes a long way to convince the interviwer that you are well-versed in Vault. 
   Here are some of possible items:

   a. Install and Setup Non-prod and prod cluster.

   b. Added users, groups and policies OR

   c. Incorporated federated logins to Vault clusters.

   d. Incorporated Vault Token into Gitlab Pipelines such that gitlab pipelines can run based on automated triggers

   e. Tested backup and recovery of Vault Clusters

   f. Migrated GCP secrets to Vault from various other places

##

#### 2. What problem does Vault solve? What value does Vault add?

   Answer:
 
     All companies have secrets (passwords, SSL certs, keys etc.). Often, these are needed in code to deploy stuff. That 
     is a significant risk, because traces of these secrets linger on in various places (like repos and logs). Vault among 
     other things, provides 3 major values:

     a. Secrets can be stored securely in one place and retrieved in an encrypted form to be used once.

     b. You can change these secrets dynamically and automatically so that even if a secret is leaked, it has no value after one use.

     c. Vault can handle many types of secrets natively (Database, AWS, Key-Value etc.)

##

#### 3. If you have no access to internet, how to do you get help on CLI?

##
   Answer:

     Vault's help is actually very good quality. Here are 3 examples:

     a. vault -h   (gets help on vault and list subcommands)

     b. vault kv -h (gets help on vault kv and lists subcommands)

     c. vault kv get -h (gets help on vault kv get)  (testmized)

##

#### 4. Why can't one secrets engine access data from another secrets engine? 

    Answer: 

      Beacuse the mechanisms are completely unique for each secret engine. 

      Example: GCP engine and AWS engine and Gitlab engine.

      Another example: kv engine works completely different than database engine. They are also kept in different PATHs.

##

#### 5. Can you have "versions" of secrets?

   Answer:

    First of all when you do "vault read secret", it tells you version number, as long as versioning is turned on.

    Example of retrieving a specific version of a secret: vault kv get -version=1 secret/foo/bar  

    (get version 1 of this secret)

   
##

#### 6. Can you un-delete a secret?

     Answer:

       Yes. vault kv undelete -version=3 secret/foo/bar 

##

#### 7. Can you get a docker image of vault server and run it on your Mac?

     Answer:
 
       docker run --cap-add=IPC_LOCK -e 'VAULT_DEV_ROOT_TOKEN_ID=myroot' -e 'VAULT_DEV_LISTEN_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0:1234' -p 8200:1234 vault
       (here the last word "vault" is the image name and we are setting parameter values on the fly)
       (tested successfully)

##

#### 8. How many keys are used in Vaults encryption process? 

    Answer:	
      Master key and 
      key for storing secrets at rest

##

#### 9. What are the three main duties of response wrapping?

   Answer: 
        A. provides cover so that actual data transmitted is not the secret in plain text format, but encrypted. 

        B. Ensure one party can unwrap the secret and 

        C. The secret has a predefined life-time (like a token).

##

#### 10. What is dev mode?

    Answer:
      It is kind of like "open and easy" mode.
      When Vault is started in dev mode, no further set up is required AND you local vault CLI has automatic access.
      This is meant for playing with vault.

##

#### 11. What does "list" command do?

    Answer: 
      This one is confusing. "list" does what it should do. e.g. list keys in a path, lists auths enabled.
      BUT , format is different for different commands (way to go Hashicorp :-) ):
      Examples:
      vault auth list (lists auths enabled) 
      vault list just-a-test/  (lists keys in that path)

##

#### 12. You have a dynamic secret set up for a database. Lease Time is 24 hours. Developer A does a "vault read" on the 
         correct path.  That generates a username and password. Developer A uses that pair to succesfully login to the 
         database. After 1 hour, Developer B (who also has access) does "vault read". Will she get a new pair of 
         username/password or the same one that Developer got?

     Answer:

       Same as Developer A

##

#### 13. Which command would bring out master key?

    Answer: 

      unseal

##

#### 14. Why do you need to get the "master key" with the unseal command?

    Answer:

       Master key is used the decrypt the encryptions keys sitting next to the secrets.

##

#### 15. What is Shamir Sealing and how does Vault use this concept?

   Answer: 

     This is basically an algorithm to safeguard the master key. A certain threshold of shards is required to reconstruct 
     the unseal key, which is then used to decrypt the master key.    

##

#### 16. How does the unseal process work?

    Answer:
      The shards are added one at a time (in any order) until enough shards are present to reconstruct the key and decrypt 
      the master key.

##

#### 17. Once a Vault node is unsealed, it remains unsealed until one of what needs to happen for it to be sealed again?

    Answer:	
      It is sealed again once "operator seal" command is run

##

#### 18. When you are writing policies, difference between + AND * ?

     Answer:
       + is single directory wildcard
       * true wild card : recursive all the way down

##

#### 19. What does that general encryption process look like in Vault?

    Answer: 
      Operator sends a secret AFTER encrypting it using base64 (to ensure safe transit).  Vault then encrypts it again using 
      its internal key before storing it at rest.

##

#### 20. What is this "cubbyhole" thing in Vault?

     Answer:
       When Vault is running for the first time, it gives everyone a PATH where,  by defauly, anyone can save secrets. That is
       "cubbyhole". Without this, one would have to create a path and change its policy just to test out the function of 
       writing and reading secrets.

##

#### 21. When you configure Vault using a configuration file, which 3 parameters must your provide?

     Answer:
       A. Cluster Name
       B. Storage Backend
       C. Seal type

##

#### 22. Name some of the advantages of using PKI:

     Answer:
       A. Reducing or eliminating certifcate revocations
       B. Reduces time to get certificates by eliminating the need to generte a private key and CSR
       C. Vault can act as an intermediate CA

##

#### 23. What is response wrapping?

    Answer: A secret , when retrived, is "wrapped" with ANOTHER token , which can be used ONLY once. This way, the real 
            token cannot be stolen in transit.
            (You can send secret in email if you want, because token can be used only once)

##

#### 24. What default policies do an Empty Policy grant in Vault?

    Answer: 
      Grants no permission at all.

##

#### 25. Can a service token be used to handle a raw request when Vault is in recovery mode? Why or why not?

    Answer:
      No. Because , while in recovery mode, only recovery tokens can be used (by rule of vault operations)

##

#### 26. What are two ways you can join a node to an existing Vault cluster?

    Answer: 
      A. using root certificate and API calls 
      B. Using consul agents running on the new vault nodes

##

#### 27. What is the function of a Google Cloud Storage Bucket when setting up Vault via GCP?

    Answer:
      It stores all the "data" of vault. (e.g. secrets).

##

#### 28. When using Google Cloud Storage, can multiple vault nodes can have access to this data from the bucket?

    Answer: 
      Yes (same idea as NAS)

##

#### 29. Should your vault cluster be able to run other workloads? Why or why not?

    Answer: 
      It can, but it should not. Running other workloads opens up variety of security concerns.

##

#### 30. Does Transit Secret Engine encrypt?
 
    Answer: 
      NO

##

#### 31. True/False: Vault Policies and Roles (Roles have policies) just like AWS.

    Answer: True   (same concept)

    user/entity ----- gets role --- role is attached to policy -- that policy gives specific permissions

##

#### 32. Can you list some of the capabilities alloted in Vault regarding policies?

    Answer: 
      create, read, update, delete, list, sudo, deny (6)

##

#### 33. Which capability takes precedence above all else?

    Answer: 
      Deny

##

#### 34. What is cubbyhole?

    Answer: 
      It is an equivalent of "safe place" at home. It is a predefined PATH. All secrets are kept there namespaced under token.
      If the token expires, secret also expires.

##

#### 37. Command to list all enabled AUTHs:

    Answer: 
      vault auth list -detailed

##

#### 38. Command to list policies?

    Answer: 
      vault policy list   (thanks to hashicorp for being counter-intuitive!) (noun + VERB)

##

#### 39. Let's say you run this command: vault list foo, what will vault server do? (Notice VERB before noun)

    Answer: 
      In this case, you put VERB ahead of noun, it will think that "foo" is a path, so, it will try do see if foo/ 
      (even though you did not put / in the end) is enabled and if so, it will give you list of keys in that path.

##

#### 40. Command to write a secret to the path: secret/teams/ with key=test1 value=junk1

    Answer:
      vault write secret/teams test1=junk1

##

#### 47. Which command is basically same as token look up?

    Answer:
      vault read auth/token/lookup-self
      (The point is that token lookup command is just reading from a PATH)

##

#### 48. In vault: "users" are called what?

    Answer: 
      Entity Ids
##

#### 49. Command to list all entity IDs?

#### 91. What is "dynamic" secret? 

    Answer:  
      A secret that is generated on demand and has a lease that expires. For example a database password that is generated on 
      the fly and will automatically expire after the lease expires. So, an entity with the right policy gets this password 
      when it needs and uses to login, but after a while (e.g. 24 hours), password is no longer valid.

##

#### 108. Is encoding same as encrypting?

     Answer:
       No! Anyone can encode and decode with base64 command.

##

#### 109. Can you have a replication set up on different cloud provider than the primary?

     Answer:
       Yes. 

##

#### 110. What can you do if a lease  of a Dynamic Secret expires ?

     Answer:
       You have to  generate a new secret because the old secret is gone and so, extending the lease of the old 
       secret doesn't help.

##
